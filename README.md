This branch of the AirholeCavityFreeGeom repository contains simulation scripts for optimizing an overcoupled airhole cavity in diamond. The optimizeNanobeamCavity.m employs a figure of merit which is sqrt(rightsidedness*guidedness*Qscat/(modeVolume^2)). That is, rightsidedness = Qx2/Qx1 and guidedness = Qscat/Qtot.

See master branch readme for more information.
